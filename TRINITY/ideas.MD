Piling down of knowledge gaps:
	* There are occassions when the rush of factoids may conceal a few 
	knowledge gaps from surfacing up. One can solve this problem
	if one has a Q-factor in the portal. We suspect there are patterns in
	the exisiting knowledge building data on wikipedia which will help
	us show this fact. We suppose that there has been rapid development
	of facts which has concealed some of the knowledge gaps in a few
	wikipedia articles.
