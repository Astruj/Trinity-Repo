Piling down of knowledge gaps:
=============================
	* There are occassions when the rush of factoids may conceal a few 
	knowledge gaps from surfacing up. One can solve this problem
	if one has a Q-factor in the portal. We suspect there are patterns in
	the exisiting knowledge building data on wikipedia which will help
	us show this fact. We suppose that there has been rapid development
	of facts which has concealed some of the knowledge gaps in a few
	wikipedia articles.

Article to FAQ:
==============
	* Given a wikipedia article, can one generate an FAQ out of this.
	* This looks like a well established research question in a form that
	  is different from the above bullet point. There are research directions
	  where one can get an answer for a query by parsing through the database.
	  This is what the KD filed is all about (Knowledge discovery).
	* As you can see, there are inumerous applications of A2FAQ, some of them being
 	  Summarize discussion forums and create an FAQ, there are some well known 
	  ways to summarize. If there are several articles written on a topic, we
	  may not be able to merge them for copyright reasons, but we can extract
	  a common FAQ out of these 'same themed' articles. For example, an article
	  on mahatma gandhi on wikipedia, plus a few new paper articles about Mahatma, 
	  followed by a few blog articles can all be used to generate a single FAQ. 
          People like reading FAQs to know about a new thing that they are less 
          familiar with than go through all these articles. Remember? We like reading
          a quora question than going through a wiki article.  

FAQ to Article:
===============

	* This is an important question in Q-wiki research (obviously?)
	* Given the discussions in SE like forum, can we generate a stub wiki article
 	  to begin with. It is better than a blank article. Assume you want to start 
	  a wiki page on faculty lounge at IIT Ropar, you may not know a thing about
 	  this unless you look into the discussion forum (assuming it exists). You
	  can easily take some content from there, summarize it and initiate a stub
	  article which will then help the contribution on the article to cascade. 	
	* We need to note that FAQ to article is slightly different from discussion 
	  forum to article. But there are some commonalities between SE and FAQ lists.
	  We need to explore more on this. 
	* This seems to have some link to Neeru's Summarization attempts. Maybe we should
	  discuss this in group.

DF to FAQ:
=========
	* It is also important to note that DF is different from an FAQ. How do we 
	  point out the important questions in DF that are valid candidates of FAQ.
	* A dumb idea: Use wikum to make DF an A and then use A2FAQ, this trasitivity
	  leads to DF2FAQ (?).

Eye Gaze idea:
============= 	
	* On DF eye gaze data might help us rank candidate questions for FAQ.
	* ORAM like secure computation to ensure that the data collected from the 
	  crowd, doesn't reveal any private information (A big question in itself).
